# Claude Session Tracker - Feature Roadmap

## Core Enhancements (From Initial Analysis)

### 1. Auto-Detection of Claude Code Launches
- [ ] Process monitoring for claude processes
- [ ] Watch Claude config files for changes
- [ ] Read Claude's JSONL files (learned from ccusage)
- [ ] Auto-start session when Claude launches
- [ ] Auto-end session when Claude closes

### 2. Project-Level Work Tracking
- [ ] Auto-detect project name from package.json, pyproject.toml, .git
- [ ] Track current git branch and last commit
- [ ] Tag sessions with project type (Node, Python, Web, etc.)
- [ ] User-defined tags for sessions
- [ ] Track files modified during session
- [ ] Integration with git for activity metrics

### 3. Multiple Timer Modes
- [ ] Claude Max mode (5 hours with warnings)
- [ ] Pomodoro mode (25 min work, 5 min break)
- [ ] Deep Work mode (90 min sessions)
- [ ] Quick Fix mode (15 min burst)
- [ ] Custom duration mode
- [ ] Break reminders based on total daily usage

### 4. Export & Analytics
- [ ] Export to CSV format
- [ ] Export to JSON format
- [ ] Generate Markdown reports
- [ ] Toggl-compatible format
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with:
  - Total hours by project
  - Daily/weekly/monthly summaries
  - Most productive times
  - Project distribution charts
- [ ] Cost tracking per project (using token data)

### 5. Intelligent Warning System
- [ ] Context-aware warnings (unsaved files, active commits)
- [ ] Customizable warning intervals
- [ ] Different warning sounds/styles
- [ ] Snooze functionality
- [ ] Health reminders for long sessions

## Insights from ccusage Comparison

### 6. Data Integration
- [ ] Read Claude's JSONL log files for automatic tracking
- [ ] Parse token usage alongside time tracking
- [ ] Calculate estimated costs per session/project
- [ ] Sync data across multiple devices

### 7. Distribution & Installation
- [ ] Create npm package for easier installation
- [ ] Cross-platform support (not just WSL)
- [ ] Homebrew formula for macOS
- [ ] Windows native installer

### 8. Advanced Integrations
- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support
- [ ] Claude Desktop integration
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Web dashboard for remote monitoring

### 9. Enhanced Diagnostics
- [ ] Token usage statistics
- [ ] Session success/timeout rate
- [ ] Project productivity metrics
- [ ] Claude API health checks

## Unique Value Propositions (Keep & Enhance)

### Our Unique Features
- [x] Real-time session warnings (30min/10min)
- [x] Windows toast notifications from WSL
- [x] Monthly session limit tracking (50/month)
- [x] Working directory tracking
- [x] Claude authentication status checks
- [ ] Prevent work loss from timeouts
- [ ] Active session management (vs passive analysis)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
1. **Auto-detection via JSONL** - Read Claude's logs like ccusage
2. **Project detection** - Basic project info extraction
3. **Export to CSV/JSON** - Simple data export
4. **Pomodoro timer** - Alternative work mode

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Medium Priority)
5. **Smart warnings** - Context-aware notifications
6. **Git integration** - Track code changes
7. **Analytics dashboard** - Basic reporting
8. **Token tracking** - Cost analysis per project

### Phase 3: Ecosystem (Future)
9. **npm package** - Easy distribution
10. **MCP server** - Claude Desktop integration
11. **VS Code extension** - IDE integration
12. **Web dashboard** - Remote monitoring

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- [ ] Refactor to modular architecture
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Database storage (SQLite) vs JSON files
- [ ] Background service architecture

## Community Features
- [ ] Share session templates
- [ ] Public productivity metrics (opt-in)
- [ ] Integration with team tools
- [ ] Productivity tips based on usage patterns

## Questions to Consider
1. Should we merge with ccusage or stay complementary?
2. Priority: Time management vs cost tracking?
3. Target audience: Individual devs vs teams?
4. Open source license choice?
5. Monetization for advanced features?
